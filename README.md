 Helmets are among the oldest forms of personal protective equipment and are known to have been worn by the Akkadians/Sumerians in the 23rd century BC. 
	The Advanced Combat Helmet (ACH) is the United States Army's current combat helmet, used since the early 2000s. It was developed by the United States Army Soldier Systems Center.

	“ Soldier can’t see the Long distance Enemy and in Foggy weather all they are helpless.”

          By all this Our Soldier can spot long distance enemy easily. In foggy weather as well in smoke they can see clearly. At night the enemy will spot instantly and they can see with the zoom function.
